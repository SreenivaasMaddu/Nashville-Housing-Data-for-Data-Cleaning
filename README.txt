Analyze the dataset: Examine the dataset to understand its structure and identify potential issues like missing values, duplicates, or inconsistent formats.

Handling missing values: Use SQL queries to identify columns with missing values (NULL). Decide on an approach to handle missing values, 
such as deleting rows with missing values, replacing them with default values, or imputing values based on certain criteria.

Standardizing data formats: Use SQL queries to identify inconsistencies in data formats, such as date formats or categorical values. 
Apply appropriate transformations to standardize the formats and ensure consistency across the dataset.

Validating data integrity: Check for data integrity issues using SQL constraints or by verifying relationships between tables. 
Ensure that the data follows the defined rules and constraints to maintain data integrity.
