Handling missing values: Used SQL queries to identify columns with missing values (NULL). Decide on an approach to handle missing values, 
such as deleting rows with missing values, replacing them with default values, or imputing values based on certain criteria.

Standardizing data formats: Used SQL queries to identify inconsistencies in data formats, such as date formats or categorical values. 
Apply appropriate transformations to standardize the formats and ensure consistency across the dataset.
